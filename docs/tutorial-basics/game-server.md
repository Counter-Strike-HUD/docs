# Game server instalation & configuration

Whole thing is builded and tested on ReHLDS. There is many advantages over native HLDS so I would reccommend using it since Valve is likely never gonna fix issues reported in HLDS.  

For scripting AmxModX is used and socket module. 
**Version recommended is 1.9** and modules related.  

Most important, server performance is not affected by running this plugin. On normal 300fps server with no clocked bandwith, plugin performs good. Tests will be provided in future.

Currently there is no Docker image or Vagrant support, but its on the way (TODO).
